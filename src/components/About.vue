      <p class="">I used to be a middle school music teacher for six years, but I decided to exchange the musical language for the programming one, and now I am in love with all the creative possibilities enabled by web development!<br/><br/>I am currently studying at Ada Tech School, a feminist and inclusive programming school with a pedagogy focused on hands-on practice.<br/><br/>To finish my studies, I am currently looking for a 12-month apprenticeship starting October (Mon-Thurs in the company / Friday at school)</p><!-- text-center lg:w-3/5 lg:pt-20 lg:text-2xl-->
